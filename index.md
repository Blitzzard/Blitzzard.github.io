## About Me

My name is Jorge and I am a high schooler. I took an internship in bioinformatics in the hope to learn new things about biology. I am a rising senior and want to pursue a medical background. It was a good opportunity to learn more about biology and the process by which they process information from test results. 

## About My Advisor

My advisors Professor Ramaraj and Colin supervised my work to make sure that my work was correct. 

## About My Project

I was involved in a project that utilized situ hybridization, microarrays, and MRI scans to collect data on various brain regions. This data was then analyzed to establish potential links between individual genes and their expression at specific voxel row numbers, particularly about a particular Structure ID found in the brain stem. This study aimed to deepen our knowledge of how the brain functions and the relationship between different structure IDs and nuclei.
