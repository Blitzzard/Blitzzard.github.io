Using R studio to do a correlation analysis on the rest of the Structure IDs. Doing a literary analysis on the different Structure IDs that are associated with their respective nucleus. Finding the different relationships in Structure IDs that are a part of the same nucleus. There are 4 that are the dorsal and ventral versions of the same nucleus. Then comparing the literary analysis of the functions with the two structure IDs to see that they match and correlate (trying to make sense of all the data).
