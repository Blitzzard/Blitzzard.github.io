## About My Project

The project I participated in was using situ hybridization, microarrays, and MRI scans to gather data on the parts of the brain. We then used this information to look into possible correlations between individual genes and their expressions at certain voxel row numbers, concerning a specific Structure-ID present within the brain stem. This is to help us better understand how the brain interacts with each other and the relationships between the structure IDs or the different nuclei.
