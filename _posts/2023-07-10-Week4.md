Trying to use R studio to visually represent results from squeeze-meta. Making a website for the projects that are being done during this program. Overlooking the work done in R studio to ensure it is correct and accounted for. Then, I went over the literature review to make it look nice and presentable. Using the outlines of the doc for the information of each structure ID to be easily accessible.
