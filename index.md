## About Me

My name is Jorge and I am a high schooler. I took an internship in bioinformatics in the hope to learn new things about biology. I am a rising senior and want to pursue a medical background. It was a good opportunity to learn more about biology and the process by which they process information from test results.

## About My Project

The project I participated in was using situ hybridization, microarrays, and MRI scans to gather data on the parts of the brain. We then used this information to look into possible correlations between individual genes and their expressions at certain voxel row numbers, concerning a specific Structure-ID present within the brain stem. This is to help us better understand how the brain interacts with each other and the relationships between the structure IDs or the different nuclei.
